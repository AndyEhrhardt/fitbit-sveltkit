      "- **REM Sleep**: 94 minutes  \n" +
      "  *A good bump upwards (+31 min), which supports memory, mood, and cognitive performance.*\n" +
      "- **Resting HR**: 54 bpm  \n" +
      "  *A low, healthy value. A slight drop indicates less stress or good recovery.*\n" +

      "  Have a balanced meal or snack 1–2 hours before working out: include complex carbs (oats, fruit, whole grains), moderate protein (yogurt, eggs, lean meat), and a bit of healthy fat (nuts, avocado).\n" +
      "- **Post-Workout**  \n" +
      "  Refuel with lean protein (chicken, tofu, beans), healthy carbs (sweet potatoes, rice, whole grains), and vegetables to support recovery.\n" +
